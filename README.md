# Objective

This project explores second-hand boat listings across Europe to uncover what factors drive pricing. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal was to determine whether attributes like size, geography, and views can help explain price variation and improve pricing strategies.

# Data
The dataset contains international boat listings with attributes such as:

- Price (in EUR)
- Length and width
- Year of manufacture
- Views over 7, 30, and 90 days
- Country of listing

Only listings priced in euros (EUR) and from 12 European countries were retained to ensure consistency and comparability.
